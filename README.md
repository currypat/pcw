This is the repository for the backend for my site, which will have a list of my work, a resume, and a blog that I probably won't use often.

AWS set up is frustrating.
I am using elastic beanstalk with an amazon provided postgresql database.
Right now I am trying to make http automatically redirect to https with eb ssh, although I do not know if this will allow me to get into the ec2 virtual machine (I assume it will).

Plans
Profile?

Resume/CV
  - static page without model backing it or model backed?

Blog
  - basic django list and detail views, only I will be able to post through the django admin
  - nice and simple static site

Workout Journal
  - should be linked to users so that CRUD operations can be displayed
  - regular django views - generic class based views
  - django rest framework api with react -- presumably the react can be served from an amazon S3 bucket
  - is there a django graphql server I can use?
  - any other frontend frameworks?

Other pages?
Travel page?

Examples of what I can make

css-grid
flexbox
bootstrap 4
basic js
leaflet
amazon web services
digital ocean
django rest framework api - workout journal
react
react and redux
graphql
Rust -- web assembly
Scalajs?
mongo?
flask?
d3?
how would I show docker? kubernetes?

other programming languages?
other front-ends?
other backends? - this seems harder than other front ends.

Examples of what I have made - Portfolio

Make sure that spatial data hub site works perfectly.
If a function is not ready, don't implement it.

other sites? I only have this one.

set up a staging version.
