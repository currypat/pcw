This is the repository for the backend for my site, which will have a list of my work, a resume, and a blog that I probably won't use often.

AWS set up is frustrating.
I am using elastic beanstalk with an amazon provided postgresql database.
Right now I am trying to make http automatically redirect to https with eb ssh, although I do not know if this will allow me to get into the ec2 virtual machine (I assume it will).

Plans
Profile?

Resume/CV
  - static page?

Blog
  - basic django list and detail views, only I will be able to post through the django admin

Workout Journal
  - should be linked to users so that CRUD operations can be displayed
  - regular django views
  - django rest framework api with react -- presumably the react can be served from an amazon S3 bucket
  - is there a django graphql server I can use?
  - any other frontend frameworks?
