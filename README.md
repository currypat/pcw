This is the repository for the backend for my site, which will have a list of my work, a resume, and a blog that I probably won't use often.

AWS set up is frustrating.
I am using elastic beanstalk with an amazon provided postgresql database.
Right now I am trying to make http automatically redirect to https with eb ssh, although I do not know if this will allow me to get into the ec2 virtual machine (I assume it will).

Plans

Resume - app?
